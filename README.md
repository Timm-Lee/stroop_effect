## Background

This is the statistically data analysis project of Stroop Effect experiments.



## Files

The projects mainly include 5 files:

* stroopdata.csv 

  —— The orgininal data given by Udacity.

* words_matter.ipynb

  —— The ipython notebook format where I performed most of this project works.

* words_matters.html

  —— Exported from ipython notebook

* words_matter.pdf

  —— Print the word_matters.html in Chrome

* README.md

  —— The file you're reading now



## Project review

The project mainly focus on the "Stroop Effect", namingly the semantic interference on corresponding time. Based on two arrays of sample data from Udacity, the data analysis of the Stroop Effect experiements results was performed by statistics. Null hypothesis was established as that results of Congruent and Incongruent experiement are identical.  Nevertheless, the outcome of the two-sample T test rejected the null hypothesis. Thus, the project demonstrated that the corresponding time in Congruent and Incongruent Stroop Effect experiments are not statistically same.
